  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This project is a static website built using Hugo and styled with Tailwind CSS.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown for a new learner:</p>
<p>Hugo:</p>
<p>Hugo is a fast static site generator written in Go. It takes your content (written in Markdown, like content/posts/my-first-post.md) and templates (HTML files in layouts) and combines them to generate a complete, ready-to-deploy website (found in the public directory).</p>
<p>Tailwind CSS:</p>
<p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing custom CSS for every element, you apply pre-defined utility classes directly in your HTML (e.g., class=&ldquo;text-blue-500 font-bold&rdquo;). Hugo&rsquo;s build process, specifically Hugo Pipes, is used to process your main.css file, which imports Tailwind CSS and then purges unused styles to keep the final CSS file small.</p>
<p>Key Directories:</p>
<p>content: Contains all your website&rsquo;s content, organized into sections (e.g., posts/). Each Markdown file here becomes a page on your site.</p>
<p>layouts: Contains the HTML templates that Hugo uses to render your content. For example, page.html renders individual pages, and home.html renders the homepage. The _partials/ directory holds reusable snippets of HTML.</p>
<p>assets: Stores static assets like CSS (assets/css/main.css) and JavaScript (themes/quickstart/assets/js/main.js) that Hugo processes.</p>
<p>public: This is where Hugo outputs the final generated website files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) after building.</p>
<p>hugo.toml: The main configuration file for your Hugo site. It defines site-wide settings, menu structures, and build options, including how Tailwind CSS is processed.</p>
<p>quickstart: This directory contains the &ldquo;quickstart&rdquo; theme, which provides the default layouts, assets, and configuration for your site.</p>
<p>Identified Errors:</p>
<p>Your project has a critical error in how it&rsquo;s overriding the theme&rsquo;s base layout, which will prevent your site from rendering correctly.</p>
<p>Incomplete baseof.html Override: The file baseof.html in your root layouts directory is overriding the theme&rsquo;s complete baseof.html. Your root baseof.html is severely truncated, only containing a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> section and missing the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, header, main content block, and footer. This means most of your page content and structure will not be rendered.</p>
<p>Non-Standard Function Call: The line {{ with (templates.Defer (dict &ldquo;key&rdquo; &ldquo;global&rdquo;)) }} in your root baseof.html uses templates.Defer, which is not a standard Hugo function. This will likely cause a build error or prevent the CSS from being included. The standard way to include a partial is {{ partial &ldquo;partial_name.html&rdquo; . }}.</p>
<p>Conflicting CSS Partial: You have a css.html in your root layouts directory. While this partial correctly uses css.TailwindCSS to process your main CSS, it&rsquo;s being called by the problematic root baseof.html. The theme&rsquo;s head.html (themes/quickstart/layouts/_partials/head.html) includes its own css.html (themes/quickstart/layouts/_partials/head/css.html), which does not use css.TailwindCSS. This setup indicates an attempt to integrate Tailwind CSS, but the baseof.html override breaks the entire layout.</p>
<p>To fix these errors and properly integrate Tailwind CSS:</p>
<p>Remove the overriding layout files: Delete the following files from your root layouts directory:</p>
<p>baseof.html
layouts/_partials/css.html</p>
<p>This will allow Hugo to use the complete and correct baseof.html and other partials from your quickstart theme.</p>
<p>Integrate Tailwind CSS into the theme&rsquo;s head partial: Modify the theme&rsquo;s CSS partial to use Hugo Pipes for Tailwind CSS.</p>
<p>After these changes, your site should render correctly, and Tailwind CSS will be processed as intended. Your hugo.toml already contains the necessary build and module.mounts configurations for Tailwind CSS and hugo_stats.json, so no changes are needed there.</p>
